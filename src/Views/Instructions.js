      <p>Following are 36 pairs of statements regarding what you want and need from your career.</p>
      <p>
        You must decide how to allocate three points between each of the pairs. For example if you strongly align with A
        and not at all with B, you would give three points to A and zero to B. If there is a draw towards both, you must
        decide which of the pair will get two points and which will get one. There is no ability to equally distribute
        the points so you must consider which statement resonates more with you.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may occassionally find yourself struggling to choose between two because they seem unrelated or irrelavant -
        this is by design. Being forced to weigh difficult decisions has proven worthwhile and allows us to get close to
        your most significant value.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, please remember that there are no right or wrong answers. It is purely personal preference - so please
        be as honest and objective as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please spend no more than 15 seconds on each question - the whole process should take approximately ten minutes.
